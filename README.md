# goal
Toolkit for high productivity web development in Go language.

Goal, being mostly inspired by [Revel Framework](https://github.com/revel/revel)
and its discussions, is built around the concept of
controllers and actions.
However, as opposed to Revel and other high level frameworks goal does not use runtime
reflection and does not require your app to import monolithic dependencies.

Instead goal is implemented in a form of independent utilities that
may be used with [`go generate`](https://blog.golang.org/generate).
That allows us to achieve type safety, minimalism of dependencies,
compatability with the standard library, and productivity for the end-developers.
At the same time goal is very customizable (you can bring your own router, template system,
and any other component). But that's without prejudice to the easiness and seamless of experience
thanks to good defaults.

Status of the project: **PoC** (not ready for use in the wild).

### Getting started
* Installation of goal toolkit.
Flag `-u` is to make sure the latest version will be installed.
```bash
go get -u github.com/colegion/goal
```

* Creation of a new skeleton application.
A new project will be saved to `$GOPATH/src/new/import/path`.
```bash
goal new new/import/path
```

* Start of a file watcher / task runner for the app.
```bash
goal run new/import/path
```

### Tools
Goal toolkit provides the following tools:

* [new](#) - create a new skeleton application.
* [run](#) - start a file watcher / task runner.
* [generate handlers](#)<sup>1</sup> - generate a package of Go handler functions from controllers.
* [generate listing](#)<sup>1</sup> - generate a list of file paths found in a requested directory.

<sup>1</sup> - tools that may be used with [`go generate`](https://blog.golang.org/generate).
